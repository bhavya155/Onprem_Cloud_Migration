üîî ADF Pipeline Email Notification 
   on Failure via Logic App (Gmail)

This project demonstrates how to send an automated email alert
using **Azure Logic Apps** and **Gmail** 
whenever an **Azure Data Factory (ADF) pipeline** fails. 
The notification helps in quickly identifying and acting upon failed pipelines in production environments.


üöÄ Technologies Used

- Azure Data Factory (ADF)
- Azure Logic App
- Gmail (SMTP)
- Web Activity
- HTTP Request Trigger
- JSON

 üìå Use Case

When an ADF pipeline activity fails, a **webhook call** is triggered to a Logic App via **Web Activity**. 
The Logic App receives the error details and sends a formatted email through Gmail to notify the data team.


üõ†Ô∏è Architecture Overview

1. **ADF Pipeline**:
   - Has a **Failure path** using dependency conditions.
   - Uses **Web Activity** to call the Logic App HTTP endpoint.

2. **Logic App**:
   - Triggered via `When an HTTP request is received`.
   - Parses failure details and sends email using Gmail connector.

üîÑ Workflow Steps

  1. Azure Data Factory

- Created pipeline with normal activities.
- On **failure path**, added a **Web activity** named `Send Failure Email`.
- Web Activity settings:
   - URL: Logic App HTTP POST URL
   - Method: POST
   - Headers: `Content-Type: application/json`
   - Body:
     ```json
       {
           "DATAFACTORYNAME": "@{pipeline().DataFactory}",
           "PIPELINENAME": "@{pipeline().Pipeline}",
           "RUNID": "@{pipeline().RunId}",
           "ERROR": "@{activity('get metadata')?.Error?.Message}"
         }

     ```

 2. Logic App

- Trigger: `When an HTTP request is received`
- Actions:
   1. Parse JSON body (optional but recommended)
           {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "DATAFACTORYNAME": {
            "type": "string"
        },
        "PIPELINENAME": {
            "type": "string"
        },
        "RUNID": {
            "type": "string"
        },
        "ERROR": {
            "type": "string"
        }
    }
}
   2. Send email via Gmail:
      - Subject: PipeLine   @{triggerBody()?['PIPELINENAME']}   DataFactory   @{triggerBody()?['DATAFACTORYNAME']}
      - Body:
        Hi Team,

        My Pipeline has failed with below error
      
        @{triggerBody()?['ERROR']}
      
        Thanks
